# Python Project

**checkbookmvp.py** is the minimum viable product. Once we had that we started working on the bonus.

**checkbookbonus.py** has the following bonus features:
- timestamps on the ledger
- option for transaction descriptions
- an option to view previous transactions input by the user

---

## Build a .py file that will be run from the command line.

- When run, the application should welcome the user, and prompt them for an action to take:
    - view current balance
    - add a debit (withdrawal)
    - add a credit (deposit)
    - exit

- The application should notify the user if the input is invalid and prompt for another choice.

- The application should persist between times that it is run.

---
