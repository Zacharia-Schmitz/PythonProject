# Python_Project

### Build a .py file that will be run from the command line.

- When run, the application should welcome the user, and prompt them for an action to take:
    - view current balance
    - add a debit (withdrawal)
    - add a credit (deposit)
    - exit

- The application should notify the user if the input is invalid and prompt for another choice.

- The application should persist between times that it is run.
